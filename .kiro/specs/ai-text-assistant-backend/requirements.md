# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an AI-powered Windows text assistant backend service. The system will provide a modular Python backend using FastAPI that serves as both a background listener and an API service for AI-powered text modification. The architecture follows Express.js-style patterns with clear separation of concerns through controllers, services, routes, and middleware components.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-structured FastAPI backend project, so that I can easily maintain and extend the AI text assistant functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is initialized THEN the system SHALL create a modular directory structure with controllers, routes, services, middlewares, and utils folders
2. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL use FastAPI framework with Express.js-style architecture patterns
3. WHEN organizing code THEN the system SHALL separate concerns with controllers handling requests, services containing business logic, routes defining API endpoints, middlewares handling cross-cutting concerns, and utils providing helper functions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want environment-based configuration management, so that I can securely manage API keys and application settings across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load configuration from environment variables
2. WHEN accessing sensitive data THEN the system SHALL support secure storage of API keys and configuration values
3. WHEN deploying to different environments THEN the system SHALL allow environment-specific configuration without code changes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want MongoDB database integration, so that I can store and retrieve application data persistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application initializes THEN the system SHALL establish a connection to MongoDB database
2. WHEN database operations are needed THEN the system SHALL provide a configured database connection setup
3. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL handle database connection errors gracefully

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want AI service integration capabilities, so that I can implement text modification features powered by AI.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing AI features THEN the system SHALL provide a service layer for AI integration
2. WHEN processing text THEN the system SHALL support AI-powered text modification operations
3. WHEN integrating with AI services THEN the system SHALL handle API communication and error scenarios

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive logging and error handling, so that I can monitor and troubleshoot the application effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requests are processed THEN the system SHALL log relevant information through middleware
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully and provide meaningful error responses
3. WHEN monitoring the system THEN the system SHALL provide structured logging for debugging and analysis

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a Windows user, I want a background listener service, so that the system can respond to text modification requests without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the service runs THEN the system SHALL operate as a background listener on Windows
2. WHEN text modification is requested THEN the system SHALL respond to background service calls
3. WHEN running continuously THEN the system SHALL maintain stable background operation
